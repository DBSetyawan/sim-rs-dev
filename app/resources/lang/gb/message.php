    'blogs' => '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition in the business world that makes PT. Krisanthium Offset Printing in order to develop its business in the printing sector and develop its assets in order to compete with the competition.
        Employees or what is also known as man power is one of the most important assets in an organization/business. With the power that is currently owned by PT. Chrysanthemum Offset Printing still needs to be developed both in terms of Soft-skills and Hard-skills, as well as leadership in order to be able to keep up with the changes that occur in the business world.
        To foster a sense of competitiveness and leadership in an organization. PT. Chrysanthemum Offset Printing in collaboration with PT. Total Quality Indonesia provides training and workshops to employees, especially employees at the level of Supervisor, Chief, Head, and Manager positions. With this event, which is held every year, it makes the team strong in an organization and can keep abreast of developments in the business world. In addition, the agenda fosters a sense of togetherness in the team and a sense of belonging to this business.
        The series of activities in the Leadership Training and Workshop agenda which was held on July 20, 2019 at Finna Golf Resort and Country Club Pandaan, included: Training, Seminar, Motivation, and Outbound. A very pleasant atmosphere made participants able to follow the event well and smoothly until it was finished. The 2-day event allowed participants from all departments to blend in and protect themselves well.
        Hopefully events like this can continue and the material for activities can be improved. And all employees can implement well what they have learned from the agenda.
